<p ><font color="white" face="blackadder ITC" size="05">>The Mysuru Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and the royal residence (house) at Mysuru in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysuru, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysuru is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysuru Palace' or 'Amba Vilas Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.

    The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"), and is now known as the new Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was burnt ablaze and constructed multiple times. The old fort was constructed using wood and thus was the reason for the old fort to catch on fire, the current fort was made up of stone, bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt down.
    
    Mysuru Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors.[1]</p>

<p>Construction
    The architectural style of domes of the palace is commonly described as Indo-Saracenic, with blends of the Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. It is a three-storey stone structure with marble domes, and has a 145-foot five-storey tower. The palace is surrounded by a large garden. The entrance gate and arch hold the emblem and coat of arms of the kingdom of Mysore, around which the kingdom's motto is written in sanskrit : "न बिभॆति कदाचन" (never terrified).

The main complex is 245 Ft in length and also 156 Ft in width. There are fire extinguishing machines located in all parts of the palace in order to prevent any fires.[5] The palace has three entrances: the East Gate (the front gate, opened only during the Dasara and for dignitaries), the South Entrance (for public), and the West Entrance (usually opened only during the Dasara).

The three-storey stone building of a fine grey granite with deep pink marble domes has a facade with several expansive arches and two smaller ones flanking the central arch, which is supported by tall pillars. Above the central arch is a sculpture of Gajalakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, prosperity, fortune, and abundance with her elephants. There are three major exclusive temple buildings within the Old Fort, and about 18 inside the palace heart building. The palace was built adjacent to the even older Parakala Mutt headquarters, whose leaders have remained the rajagurus (royal teacher and guide) of Mysore kings. The kings of Mysore were devotees of Goddess Chamundi, hence the palace's facing the Chamundi Hills.[6]

The palace houses two durbar halls (ceremonial meeting halls of the royal court) and incorporates an array of courtyards, gardens, and buildings.</p>

<p>Sheesh Mahal or the Hall of Mirrors is situated at Amber fort in Jaipur. Build by Raja Man Singh in 1592 with red sandstone and white marble, the beauty of this fort is blown up by the Maotha Lake. Sheesh Mahal is one of the world famous forts because of its unique construction. The ceilings and walls of the hall are superbly covered with the mirrors that would reflect any splash of ray and light up the hall deliberately.</p>
