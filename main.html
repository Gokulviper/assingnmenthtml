    <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/;[4] lit. 'Crown of the Palace', [taːdʒ ˈmɛːɦ(ə)l]),[5] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

    <p>Lalbagh Botanical Garden or shortened Lalbagh, is an old botanical garden in Bengaluru, India. First planned and laid out during the dalavaiship of Hyder Ali and later managed under numerous British Superintendents before Indian Independence. It was responsible for the introduction and propagation of numerous ornamental plants as well as those of economic value. It also served a social function as a park and recreational space, with a central glass house dating from 1890 which was used for flower shows. In modern times it hosts two flower shows coinciding with the week of Republic Day (26 January) and Independence Day (15 August). As an urban green space along with Cubbon Park, it is also home to numerous wild species of birds and other wildlife. The garden also has a lake adjoining a large rock on which a watchtower had been constructed during the reign of Kempegowda II.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Located in the heart of Jaipur, the City Palace of Jaipur was once the Maharaja’s reign. The complex of the palace includes the Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal and many other courtyards and buildings. Initially built by Sawai Jai Singh II between 1729 and 1732 AD, many additions have been made in the original architecture of the palace by the other rulers later in the 20th century. The architectural style of this old building was largely based on the blend of Mughal, Rajput and European styles. The Chandra Mahal of the complex has been now turned into a museum showcasing unique handcrafted products, uniforms of the rulers of ancient time and lots more related to the royal inheritance </p>
